## Nexus Workbench

The project defines an SBT plugin that aids in the development of SHACL schemas in JSON-LD format for use in the
Nexus platform.

### Building the project

The project depends on the [sbt nexus](https://github.com/bluebrain/sbt-nexus) plugin and
[nexus-commons](https://github.com/bluebrain/nexus-commons).  Until stable versions of these dependencies are released,
in order to build the project, these dependencies need to be published locally.
